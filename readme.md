## Team Profile Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a team profile generator that prompts the user to fill out the relevant fields to build their team. The app uses the inquirer package to capture the data input by the user and creates an html page featuring each employee and their role. The app also uses jest to test the content.

Once the file is downloaded, open it with VS Code or a similar code editor with node js installed. From there, install the node package modules via npm i, and then enter 'node index.js' in the command line.

## Usage

## Tests

Install npm. From there, run node index.js, which will initiate a series of prompts for the user to complete, pertaining to the relevant information contained in the profile to be generated. Once the user fills out each form, the profile generator will be written to the dist folder.

## Notes

It took me forever to realize I needed create the dist folder in order for the CSS to load.
